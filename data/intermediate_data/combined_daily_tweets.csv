2017-01-03,the democrat governor of minnesota said the affordable care act obamacare is no longer affordable and it is lousy healthcare  people must remember that obamacare just doesnt work and it is not affordable increases arizona bill clinton called it crazy  general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to u s car dealers tax free across border make in u s a or pay big border tax  china has been taking out massive amounts of money amp wealth from the u s in totally one sided trade but wont help with north korea nice  north korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the u s it wont happen  i thought and felt i would win big easily over the fabled when they cancelled fireworks they knew and so did i  various media outlets and pundits say that i thought i was going to lose the election wrong it all came together in the last week and  just released a book called unprecedented which explores the race amp victory hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me  chicago murder rate is record setting shooting victims with murders in if mayor cant do it he must ask for federal help 
2017-01-04,massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful  like the hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless dont let the schumer clowns out of this web  republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases  things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass  somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible  thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating new jobs in the u s this is just the beginning much more to follow  julian assange said a year old could have hacked podesta why was dnc so careless also said russians did not give him the info  the intelligence briefing on so called russian hacking was delayed until friday perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange  i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in n y c thank you  trump is already delivering the jobs he promised america  there should be no further releases from gitmo these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield  instead of driving jobs and wealth away america will become the worlds great magnet for innovation amp job creation  may be their number one act and priority focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance  with all that congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair as it 
2017-01-05,to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan  the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people  time for republicans amp democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive amp far better  do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginning keep you doctor keep your plan it is  the democrats lead by head clown chuck schumer know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in instead of working to fix it they  jackie evanchos album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance some people just dont understand the movement

2017-01-07,only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed  intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results voting machines not touched  gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take place the republican national committee had strong defense  happy birthday  monitoring the terrible situation in florida just spoke to governor scott thoughts and prayers for all stay safe  i am asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with nbc prior to me seeing it

2018-02-18,great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot big gain over last weeks i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans the cuts the dems want to take away we need more republicans  the fake news of big ratings loser cnn  if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the u s then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams they are laughing their asses off in moscow get smart america  now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the election but wasn t i a great candidate  i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia it never did  finally liddle adam schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam  never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation  general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company  very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud  just like they don t want to solve the daca problem why didn t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house amp senate during the obama administration because they didn t want to and now they just talk  i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was not the main goal rob goldmanvice president of facebook ads  the fake news media never fails hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads rob goldman  funny how the fake news media doesn t want to say that the russian group was formed in long before my run for president maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn t know  deputy a g rod rosenstein stated at the news conference there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the election  charges deal don a big win written by michael goodwin of the succinctly states that the russians had no impact on the election results there was no collusion with the trump campaign she lost the old fashioned way by being a terrible candidate case closed  melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county florida will never forget them or the evening

2018-07-20,so important should have been done years ago  farmers have been on a downward trend for years the price of soybeans has fallen since years before the election a big reason is bad terrible trade deals with other countries they put on massive tariffs and barriers canada charges on dairy farmers will win  the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well tightening now hurts all that we have done the u s should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals debt coming due amp we are raising rates really  china the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the u s is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge as usual not a level playing field  my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri such a tragedy such a great loss may god be with you all  will the dems and fake news ever learn this is classic 
2018-07-21,inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer s office early in the morning almost unheard of even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of amp perhaps illegal the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong  the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again can t believe it isn t it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart the commissioner must now make a stand first time kneeling out for game second time kneeling out for season no pay  i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin in the old days they would call it diplomacy if i was loud amp vicious i would have been criticized for being too tough remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim hypocrites 
2018-07-22,i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it so bad for our country  on source was the fake dossier yes the dirty dossier paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump and looking for information that could discredit candidate trump carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign illegal  andrew mccarthy i said this could never happen this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it it is so bad it screams out at you on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt  looking more amp more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam  congratulations to and on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of justice and fbi misled the courts witch hunt rigged a scam  watching los angeles possible hostage situation very closely active barricaded suspect l a p d working with federal law enforcement  troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime amp borders troy is the total opposite and loves our military vets amp nd amendment early voting just started with election day on august th troy has my full amp total endorsement  brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with vp brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the nd amendment he will be a great governor  brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the nd amendment he will be a great governor  no collusion no obstruction but that doesn t matter because the angry democrats who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing  the rigged witch hunt headed by the angry democrats and now more have been added one who worked directly for obama w h seems intent on damaging the republican party s chances in the november election this democrat excuse for losing the election never ends 
2018-07-23,in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for amazon is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought  the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the u s supreme court two months ago next up is the u s post office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a big percentage of their packages  a rocket has not been launched by north korea in months likewise no nuclear tests japan is happy all of asia is happy but the fake news is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that i am angry because it is not going fast enough wrong very happy  when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin and all that i gave up remember i gave up nothing we merely talked about future benefits for both countries also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the corrupt media  carter page wasn t a spy wasn t an agent of the russians he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump tom fitton a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now  and the doj fbi and obama gang need to be held to account source was the major source avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team not about carter page was all about getting trump  it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump  so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly amp falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt  tom fitton on at a m now judicial watch  to iranian president rouhani never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence amp death be cautious  so president obama knew about russia before the election why didn t he do something about it why didn t he tell our campaign because it is all a big hoax that s why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win  happy birthday

2018-12-24,we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the u s and our taxpayers on trade general mattis did not see this as a problem i do and it is being fixed  to those few senators who think i don t like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do what i don t like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade  virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it desperately needed  president of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syria and he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right next door our troops are coming home  the president has been remarkable i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning  the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border we need border security and as everyone knows you can t have border security without a wall the drones amp technology are just bells and whistles safety for america  mitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the u s senate for years and the last two have been by far the best amp most productive of his career tax amp regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships amp much more great  it should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world this is what president trump recognized in iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he s right the generals still don t get the mistake  thanks i am very proud of the president this is exactly what he promised and i think the people agree with him we ve been at war too long and in too many places spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere he s different that s why he got elected  bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal which i ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement i said no and the game was over i love tennessee  senator bob corker just stated that i m so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and that s what i told the people of our state that s what i d do serve for two terms but that is not true wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldn t endorse him  we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is the mistake of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars it all began years ago  unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for we are praying for recovery and healing america is with you  i just had a long and productive call with president of turkey we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria amp the slow amp highly coordinated pullout of u s troops from the area after many years they are coming home we also discussed heavily expanded trade  i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy amp previously boeing he will be great 
2018-12-25,merry christmas  i am in the oval office amp just gave out a mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas we are already building and renovating many miles of wall some complete democrats must end shutdown and finish funding billions of dollars amp lives will be saved  christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea progress being made looking forward to my next summit with chairman kim  i am all alone poor me in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about crazy  saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states see isn t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the u s that is miles away thanks to saudi a  the wall is different than the billion dollars in border security the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand the reporting has been inaccurate on the point the problem is without the wall much of the rest of dollars are wasted  i never lashed out at the acting attorney general of the u s a man for whom i have great respect this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media  the only problem our economy has is the fed they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt  america is respected again  for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with billion dollars in cash amp sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal now terminated approved by little bob corker

2018-12-27,have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members amp criminals from coming into our country do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats  just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany one thing is certain we have incredible people representing our country people that know how to win  melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq god bless the u s a 
2018-12-28,thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany great things are happening  honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it we will be cutting off all aid to these countries taking advantage of u s for years  close the southern border bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs go back to pre nafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico either we build finish the wall or we close the border  the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over billion dollars a year not including drug money which would be many times that amount that i would consider closing the southern border a profit making operation we build a wall or  we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall amp also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with hard to believe there was a congress amp president who would approve  cnn amp others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign can you imagine my saying no we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported  this isn t about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly in israel the wall works this is only about the dems not letting donald trump amp the republicans have a win they may have the senate votes but we have the issue border security  brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the president says look this is your neighborhood you ve got to stand up to protect yourselves don t always look to america  brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the pesident says look this is your neighborhood you ve got to stand up to protect yourselves don t always look to america  i totally agree  there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop time to get tough on border security build the wall  border patrol agents want the wall democrat s say they don t want the wall even though they know it is really needed and they don t want ice they don t have much to campaign on do they an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity  the reason the daca for wall deal didn t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and that s where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall  the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of great people wanting amp expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a u s record  the reason the daca for wall deal didn t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supteme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and that s where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall 
2018-12-30,it turns out to be true now that the department of justice and the fbi under president obama rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump and now it looks like in a corrupt amp illegal way the facts are out now whole hoax exposed  absolutely nothing on russian collusion kimberley strassel the wall street journal the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats  is being called the year of the worker by steve moore co author of trumponomics it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the best job market in years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers big wage gains  for those that naively ask why didn t the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need democrat votes and they will gives us none for border security now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad  children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn t given her water in days border patrol needs the wall and it will all end they are working so hard amp getting so little credit  any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally they can t if we had a wall they wouldn t even try the two  just had a long and very good call with president xi of china deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made  i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military  the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax this is a total obstruction of justice all texts demanded 
2018-12-31,i am the only person in america who could say that i m bringing our great troops back home with victory and get bad press it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy  i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall our southern border has long been an open wound where drugs criminals including human traffickers and illegals would pour into our country dems should get back here an fix now  except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be i campaigned against the never ending wars remember  i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me amp my tactics which are working just doing what i said i was going to do  if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero isis is mostly gone we re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants  an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me  president and mrs obama built has a ten foot wall around their d c mansion compound i agree totally necessary for their safety and security the u s needs the same thing slightly larger version  great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans  veterans on president trump s handling of border security approval rating on being a strong leader ap poll thank you 
2019-01-01,the democrats much as i suspected have allocated no money for a new wall so imaginative the problem is without a wall there can be no real border security and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border  happy new year  happy new year to everyone including the haters and the fake news media will be a fantastic year for those not suffering from trump derangement syndrome just calm down and enjoy the ride great things are happening for our country  dr sebastian gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out why we fight lots of insight enjoy  remember this throughout the ages some things never get better and never change you have walls and you have wheels it was always that way and it will always be that way please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall  the democrats will probably submit a bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security namely the wall you see without the wall there can be no border security the tech stuff is just by comparison meaningless bells amp whistles  mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the u s a is saving through the new trade deal the usmca that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal which has so badly hurt our country mexico amp canada will also thrive good for all  happy new year  heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from  senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country very unfair  it s incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesn t work it does and properly built almost they say it s old technology but so is the wheel they now say it is immoral but it is far more immoral for people to be dying  i m in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in and one more yes but with me in office i ll get it built and fast  i m in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in and one more yes but with me in office i ll get it built and fast

2019-03-31,the trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the u s or our allies that s the definition of a foreign policy achievement bret stephens we are getting stronger all over the world watch  mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa our detention areas are maxed out amp we will take no more illegals next step is to close the border this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico  it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved but the dems don t care about the crime they don t want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa 
2019-04-01,no matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough behind closed doors the dems are laughing  the cost of obamacare is far too high for our great citizens the deductibles in many cases way over make it almost worthless or unusable good things are going to happen  can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question report would be meaningless and a waste of the billions ridiculous that it costs to put together  democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly we have a major national emergency at our border get it done now  now that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and othershave gone back to the pre witch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists  the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long  outrageous it s the adam schiff problem people abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didn t prove to be true you look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival who made it james freeman  everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began we need to know for future generations to understand this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again 
2019-04-02,i haven t seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us they have an open invitation we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity we are at an emergency crisis art del cueto national border patrol council    after many years decades mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador they have all been taking u s money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress  there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country  robert mueller was a god like figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited mueller report now the dems don t even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again it won t happen  world autism awareness day significance history and theme via  in rep jerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton no information whatsoever would or could be legally released but with the no collusion mueller report which the dems hate he wants it all nothing will ever satisfy them  the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j trump so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation  puerto rico got billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before amp all their local politicians do is complain amp ask for more money the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly amp only take from usa  the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job of bringing the island back to health billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful  are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas amp florida combined yet their government can t do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema amp the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like  the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any place in history the people of puerto rico  back the house it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america also republicans will always support pre existing conditions the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare meantime the usa is doing better than ever amp is respected again  are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums cost amp deductibles than obamacare in other words it will be far less expensive amp much more usable than obamacare vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate amp win  everybody agrees that obamacare doesn t work premiums amp deductibles are far too high really bad healthcare even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance the republicans  democrats should stop fighting sen david perdue s disaster relief bill they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america 
2019-04-03,congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border if no action border or large sections of border will close this is a national emergency  this will be a great campaign issue i never asked mitch mcconnell for a vote before the election as has been incorrectly reported as usual in the but only after the election when we take back the house etc republicans will always support pre existing conditions  i was never planning a vote prior to the election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me amp the republican party it will be on full display during the election as a much better amp less expensive alternative to obamacare  today it was my great honor to welcome secretary general to the  today we celebrate the tremendous accomplishments of americans with asd and reaffirm our commitment to work together to ensure that every member of our society is afforded equal opportunities to reach their full potential 
2019-04-04,there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country  according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started so illegal  despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high  the republican party is the party of the american dream  the first step act proves that our country can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we put politics aside and put the interests of all americans first

products will be granted or go to new source  if we bought billion dollars of agriculture from our farmers far more than china buys now we would have more than billion dollars left over for new infrastructure healthcare or anything else china would greatly slow down and we would automatically speed up  talks with china continue in a very congenial manner there is absolutely no need to rush as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of on billion dollars worth of goods amp products these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the u s  the process has begun to place additional tariffs at on the remaining billion dollars the u s only sells china approximately billion dollars of goods amp products a very big imbalance with the over billion dollars in tariffs that we take in we will buy  republicans must stick together  james comey is a disgrace to the fbi amp will go down as the worst director in its long and once proud history he brought the fbi down almost all republicans amp democrats thought he should be fired but the fbi will regain greatness because of the great men amp women who work there  house republicans should not vote for the bad democrat disaster supplemental bill which hurts our states farmers amp border security up for vote tomorrow we want to do much better than this all sides keep working and send a good bill for

2019-05-11,such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple  military spouses share an admirable legacy of unwavering devotion to their loved ones in uniform and to the cause of freedom on military spouse day we honor our nation s military spouses and express our deep appreciation for all that they do  over the course of the past two days the united states and china have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries the relationship between president xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations  into the future will continue in the meantime the united states has imposed tariffs on china which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations  great republican vote today on disaster relief bill we will now work out a bipartisan solution that gets relief for our great states and farmers thank you to all get me a bill that i can quickly sign 
2019-05-12,think of it i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation from long before i ever took office i was under a sick amp unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian  hoax my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction this must never be allowed to happen again  the democrats have nothing just want to distract from this president the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary at the end of the day they re fearful of what they did and should be fearful this is a tough  president who is willing to have the battle and we have a great attorney general who is willing to lead the battle and they are going to get to the bottom of it  i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller never a big fan  the only problem is that they know i am going to win best economy amp employment numbers in u s history amp much more and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs  i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election to see if they could get lucky amp have a democrat win in which case they would continue to rip off the usa for billion a year  so now the radical left dems don t talk about collusion anymore because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime except for the crimes committed by the other side  i won the election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit which i still am and the voters didn t care now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter make it a part of the election 
2019-05-13,democrat rep tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the holocaust she obviously has tremendous hatred of israel and the jewish people can you imagine what would happen if i ever said what she said and says  bernie sanders the economy is doing well and i m sure i don t have to give trump any credit i m sure he ll take all the credit that he wants wrong bernie the economy is doing great and would have crashed if my opponent and yours crooked hillary clinton had ever won  has anyone noticed that all the boston have done is win since coming to the white house others also have done very well the white house visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of sports illustrated by the way the boston players were great guys  the unexpectedly good first quarter gdp was greatly helped by tariffs from china some people just don t get it  also congratulations to on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump thank you president trump  thank you great show this morning and congratulations on your number one by far rating well deserved  i say openly to president xi amp all of my many friends in china that china will be hurt very badly if you don t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave china for other countries too expensive to buy in china you had a great deal almost completed amp you backed out  their is no reason for the u s consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only points were paid by the u s points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be  completely avoided if you by from a non tariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea that s zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia that s why china wants to make a deal so badly  there will be nobody left in china to do business with very bad for china very good for usa but china has taken so advantage of the u s for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliate will only get worse  it s the attack strategy of harass this is not about the attorney general who is very sophisticated amp knows it isn t about him it s about trying to destroy president trump through an assault on his ag for upholding the rule of law he released a massive amount of  information as long as president trump is president his opposition will use every tool and misuse every tool available to make his life miserable sadly this proves i am doing a great job also best economy and employment numbers ever  just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the democrats that began during the obama administration continued through the mueller fbi operation amp now the baton has been passed to jerry nadler to continue to abuse power to harass president trump  and the democrat national committee the democrat party apparatus has been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent me the fbi has no leadership the director is protecting the same gang that tried to  overthrow the president through an illegal coup recommended by previous doj  even director james clapper admits that the fbi actions against the trump presidential campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying perhaps fbi director christopher wray will be the next to do so  china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in they love ripping off america  the constitutional crisis is the democrats refusing to work let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border  when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia of course it was supposed to be over back to work for the people but the dems have gone nuts and it has actually gotten worse hope the republicans win back the house in or little will get done  ever since the mueller report showed no collusion amp no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason that s all they want to do don t care about anything else  despite two years and millions of dollars spent the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started it is all a big hoax the biggest in american history  the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a constitutional crisis they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible they are a sad joke we may have the strongest economy in our history best  employment numbers ever low taxes amp regulations a rebuilt military amp v a many great new judges amp so much more but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax that is the constitutional crisis amp hopefully guilty people will pay  we are right where we want to be with china remember they broke the deal with us amp tried to renegotiate we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa ideal or buy it from non tariffed countries  we will then spend match or better the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers agriculture which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world great  really sad    big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media not good   
2019-05-14,our great senator and star from the state of arkansas has just completed a wonderful book sacred duty about arlington national cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion on sale today make it big  china will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing if the federal reserve ever did a match it would be game over we win in any event china wants a deal  our great senator and star from the state of arkansas has just completed a wonderful book sacred duty about arlington national cemetary and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion on sale today make it big  our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy  this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us the farmers have been forgotten for many years their time is now  when the time is right we will make a deal with china my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesn t make any sense we have to be allowed to make up some  of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto it will all happen and much faster than people think  we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal no way we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made will be taking in  billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong other countries are already negotiating with us because they don t want this to happen to them they must be a part of usa action this should have been done by our leaders many years ago enjoy  so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great election we are the piggy bank that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of no more  china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff you can also buy from a non tariffed country instead of china many companies are leaving china  in one year tariffs have rebuilt our steel industry it is booming we placed a tariff on dumped steel from china amp other countries and we now have a big and growing industry we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong  i met marine sgt john peck a quadruple

so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliate will only get worse  there is no reason for the u s consumer to pay the tariffs which take

2019-06-10,    when will the failing new york times admit that their front page story on the the new mexico deal at the border is a fraud and nothing more than a badly reported hit job on me something that has been going on since the first day i announced for the presidency sick journalism  we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the u s has been asking about getting for many years it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by mexico s legislative body  we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming tariffs will be reinstated  now with our new deal mexico is doing more for the usa on illegal immigration than the democrats in fact the democrats are doing nothing they want open borderswhich means illigal immigration drugs and crime  the failing story on mexico and illegal immigration through our southern border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it the only problem is that they knew it was fake news before it went out corrupt media  for two years all the democrats talked about was the mueller report because they knew that it was loaded up with angry democrat trump haters later increased to but despite the bias when the report came out the findings were no collusion and facts that led to  no obstruction the dems were devastated after all this time and money spent the mueller report was a disaster for them but they want a redo or do over they are even bringing in sleazebag attorney john dean sorry no do overs go back to work 
2019-06-11,why did the democrats run if they didn t want to do things  good day in the stock market people have no idea the tremendous potential our country has for growth and many other things  if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of tariff so far little effect to consumer companies will relocate to u s  companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass but very happy with the deal i made  maria dagan steve stuart v when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and most importantly a powerful way to get  this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the u s at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don t have a clue  the united states has very low inflation a beautiful thing  this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the u s at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way to high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they don t have a clue  sad when you think about it but mexico right now is doing more for the united states at the border than the democrats in congress  presidential harassment  investigation in the senate they can talk to john dean until the cows come home we re not doing anything in the senate regarding the mueller report we are going to harden our infrastructure against  mueller has spoken he found no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians the bottom line is what the democrat house is doing is trying to destroy the trump presidency which has been a tremendous success and i can assure you that we re done with the mueller  jerry nadler s trump bashing show is a bust headline new york post the greatest witch hunt of all time continues all crimes were by the other side but the committee refuses to even take a look deleting emails is the real obstruction and much more  new book just out the real deal my decade fighting battles and winning wars with trump is really wonderful it is written by two people who are very smart amp know me well george sorial amp damian bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who i am enjoy        despite the phony witch hunt we will continue to make america great again thank you  congratulations to the indianapolis winner and  i have been briefed on the helicopter crash in new york city phenomenal job by our great first responders who are currently on the scene thank you for all you do the trump administration stands ready should you need anything at all  can t believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor no collusion no obstruction democrats just want a do over which they ll never get  thank you and john eastman

2019-07-09,recent strained decisions by the united states supreme court some so simple as allowing the question are you a citizen of the united states on our very expensive census report or the even more strained decisions allowing the world s most expensive amp pathetic  healthcare obamacare to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming election is i have long heard that the appointment of supreme court justices is a president s most important decision so true  india has long had a field day putting tariffs on american products no longer acceptable  food stamp participation hits year low wow  with president trump at the helm not only is america getting great again but he s going to make our estuaries our rivers our water everything better the things he is doing and done are just helping america tremendously thank you to bruce hrobak  outrage is growing in the great state of minnesota where our patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the pledge of allegiance i will be fighting with you  i agree with the president the supreme court got it wrong there should be a question about citizenship on the census a g barr sees a pathway to add the citizenship question steve doocy working hard on something that should be so easy people are fed up  the wacky ambassador that the u k foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was  handled i told how to do that deal but she went her own foolish way was unable to get it done a disaster i don t know the ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool tell him the usa now has the best economy amp military anywhere in the world by far  and they are both only getting bigger better and stronger thank you mr president  very good numbers on the economy much potential for growth trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation we have been treated very unfairly to put it mildly by other countries for many years but that is changing  spoke to kevin mccarthy about the earthquakes in california and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding also spoke to governor all working together  i have been very critical about the way the u k and prime minister theresa may handled brexit what a mess she and her representatives have created i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well  thought of within the u s we will no longer deal with him the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with  brilliant constitutional lawyer dr john eastman said the special prosecutor mueller should have never been appointed in the first place the entire exercise was fundamentally illegal the witch hunt should never happen to another president of the u s again a total scam 
2019-07-10,iran has long been secretly enriching in total violation of the terrible billion dollar deal made by john kerry and the obama administration remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years sanctions will soon be increased substantially  the dems witch hunt continues  done a great job of reducing crime in the african american community because more african americans are at work today trump is not a racist he s a businessman because he s a great businessman he s pushing for lives to be better michael brown ceo hydromatic tech  our company has grown since trump has taken control of the white house amp the presidency in the sense that we have better opportunities now to do what we ve been wanting to do for quite some time and that is to create manufacturing jobs i believe that president trump has  fbi s christopher steele fake story falls apart false intel amp media contacts were flagged before fisa john solomon the hill  the reality is that this was a plot from the very beginning to frame trump      so now the obama appointed judge on the census case are you a citizen of the united states won t let the justice department use the lawyers that it wants to use could this be a first  more and more the radical left is using commerce to hurt their enemy they put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their so called followers not to do business there they don t care who gets hurt but also don t understand that two can play that game  a truly great patriotic amp charitable man bernie marcus the co founder of home depot who at the age of is coming under attack by the radical left democrats with one of their often used weapons they don t want people to shop at those great stores because he contributed  to your favorite president me these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people deplorables in this country than bad do to them what they do to you fight for bernie marcus and home depot  why would kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in congress the senate majority leader for a freshman senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party we need mitch in the senate to keep america great  democrats are coming after our great kentucky senator mitch mcconnell with someone who compared my election to september th  after a wonderful dinner at the last night with the amir of qatar it was my great honor to welcome him to the this afternoon 
2019-07-11,dow just hit for first time ever  it seems that the brits and the french and the germans are coming around to the idea that the iranians are up to no good  mexico is doing great at the border but china is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great farmers that they said they would hopefully they will start soon  will be a big and exciting day at the white house for social media  now the democrats have asked to see more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum they also want to interview the highly  conflicted and compromised mueller again he said he was done after his last minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report enough already go back to work i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday  democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called kids in cages inhumane treatment at the border because the horrible picture used was from the obama years very embarrassing  and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world they wanted my business and so did many others  the fake news media loves the narrative that i didn t use many banks because the banks didn t like me no i didn t use many banks because i didn t don t need their money old fashioned isn t it if i did it would have been very easy for me to get  robert johnson b e t i give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that s benefiting a large number of americans i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy overall if you look at the u s economy and you look at  the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you ve got to give the president an a plus for that thank you robert one of our great business leaders  months the lowest since the wall street journal editorial board a tale of two economies  nearly one million more blacks and two million more hispanics are employed than when barrack obama left office and minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the trump presidency unemployment among black women has hovered near for the last six  the pledge of allegiance to our great country in st louis park minnesota is under siege that is why i am going to win the great state of minnesota in the election people are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful usa  the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six  years or maybe or just kidding

2019-07-29,the fed raised way too early and way too much their quantitative tightening was another big mistake while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering we are competing with other  countries that know how to play the game against the u s that s actually why the e u was formed and for china until now the u s has been easy pickens the fed has made all of the wrong moves a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway  even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call  crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe  the e u and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison too bad  al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events he would say it s a personal favor to me seldom but sometimes i would go it was fine he came to my office in t t during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me just a conman at work  if the democrats are going to defend the radical left squad and king elijah s baltimore fail it will be a long road to the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket  baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation years of all talk no action so tired of listening to the same old bull next reverend al will show up to complain amp protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad  i have known al for years went to fights with him amp don king always got along well he loved trump he would ask me for favors often al is a con man a troublemaker always looking for a score just doing his thing must have intimidated comcast nbc hates whites amp cops  good luck with the book george should do well  law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended be careful and safe  the democrats hate this president so much they re forgetting about their duty to secure our border sad but true  if the democrats would have closed the loopholes two years ago when president trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have happened  be leaving office on august th i would like to thank dan for his great service to our country the acting director will be named shortly  i am pleased to announce that highly respected congressman john ratcliffe of texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence a former u s attorney john will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves dan coats the current director will  under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states no president has come close to doing this before i also created successful opportunity zones waiting for nancy and elijah to say thank you mr president  if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership his radical oversight is a joke  there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame

a net energy exporter amp now the number one energy producer in the world we don t need middle eastern oil amp gas amp in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies  the this week the senate passed a milestone in confirming the th federal judge of mr trump s administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping barack obama s pace and fulfilling pledges by mr trump and mr o connell to remake the federal judiciary  these conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump nominees the entire court system is changing at a record pace  house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and spent zero collusion zero obstruction so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that trump has done over his lifetime but it doesn t  work that way i have a better idea look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the congressional slush fund and lastly the ig reports take a look at them those investigations would be over fast  we cannot have what happened to this president happen again joe digenova it is time for justice to come barreling in can you imagine that with everything going on in this world the witch hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along a disgrace  the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran no conditions that is an incorrect statement as usual  here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers get together and make a deal  plenty of oil  saudi arabia oil supply was attacked there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed  sufficient to keep the markets well supplied i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states  based on the attack on saudi arabia which may have an impact on oil prices i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if needed in a to be determined amount  then on top of it all kathleen parker of all people wrote in case you were wondering trump won the debate true but what is going on at the not fake news  can t believe the wrote a positive front page story unity issue has parties pointing to trump gop goes all in while democrats clash over ideology amp tactics mr president we are with you the entire way republicans have coalesced around trump  i am fighting the fake

winning big th federal judge this week  can t let brett kavanaugh give radical left democrat liberal plus opinions based on threats of impeaching him over made up stories sound familiar false allegations and lies this is the game they play fake and corrupt news is working overtime

2019-09-22,will be in houston to be with my friend will be a great day in texas  they are trying to destroy and influence justice kavanaugh a very good man correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are  i go along with joe  go across the world and you ll see either very low interest rates or negative rates the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i don t think he ll fire jay powell even if i should we should always be paying less interest than others  the real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs peter schweizer laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china he knew nothing about energy or anything else    when someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the election as he did then he gets to set the national agenda the press is just outrages this story is the most irresponsible thing i ve ever seen i agree they also lose too much  the fake news media nowadays not only doesn t check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats it is so wrong but they don t even care anymore they have gone totally crazy  the lamestream media had a very bad week they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post they are the enemy of the people  ukraine foreign minister disputes reports of any pressure from trump this conversation was long friendly and it touched on many questions correct if your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of sleepy joe he is being protected by the media  they re trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal the problem is trump did nothing wrong  it appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on trump s conversation  with a foreign leader was this person officially asked to listen to the conversation or was he or she secretly listening in  the pretend ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the obama clinton gang criminal classified leaks and spying targeting trump again  they re trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal the problem is trump did nothing wrong        some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democrat fake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen make america great again

more corrupt than the bidens which is hard to do  very simple i was looking for corruption and also why germany france and others in the european union don t do more for ukraine why is it always the usa that does so much and puts up so much money for ukraine and other countries by the way the bidens were corrupt  they made this whole thing up impeachment is also a pre emptive strike for what they think is coming on the obama administration s handling of the election jim mclaughlin highly respected pollster  president trump s job approval numbers have just reached the highest level since his

released to congress amp the public the whistleblower knew almost nothing its nd hand description of the call is a fraud  china trade turmoil china urging a calm and rational solution china is doing very poorly while the usa under your favorite president s leadership continues to soar to new heights and despite the do nothing democrats we have just begun  the greatest witch hunt in the history of

civil war like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal pastor robert jeffress  rid of donald j trump and the democrats don t care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the  election and negate the votes of

will never forgive him  nancy pelosi and the democrats can t put down the impeachment match they know they couldn t beat him in against hillary clinton and they re increasingly aware of the fact that they won t win against him in and impeachment is the only tool they have to get  state department has stepped up hillary clinton email probe you mean the emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all pertained only to her daughter s wedding and her yoga  all that s swirling around us now is impeachment we talk about it day and night it s what s

2019-10-07,the radical left democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local new york city and state democrat prosecutors to go get president trump a thing like this has never happened to any president before not even close  doesn t even include the almost that the families got from the trump tax cut stephen moore freedomworks that means to more in disposable yearly income that americans have right now because of president trump  heritage foundation these numbers are blockbusters just since donald trump took office median family incomrs are up over in years under president obama they only went up in one third the time president trump has increased incomes times as much and that  incomes much higher under trump than bush obama and almost everything else is better also except i am driving the deep state and the radical left do nothing democrats crazy  ig declassified information contradicts the whistleblower but why are people surprised the partisan whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect no pressure call with the ukrainian president bring in another whistleblower from the bench  we just won the big court case on net neutrality rules a great win for the future and speed of the internet will lead to many big things including g congratulations to the fcc and its chairman ajit pai  figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured isis fighters in their neighborhood they all hate isis have been enemies for years we are miles away and will crush isis again if they come anywhere near us  almost years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win turkey europe syria iran iraq russia and the kurds will now have to  including capturing thousands of isis fighters mostly from europe but europe did not want them back they said you keep them usa i said no we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in u s prisons at tremendous cost they are yours for trials they  again said no thinking as usual that the u s is always the sucker on nato on trade on everything the kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so they have been fighting turkey for decades i held off this fight for  the united states was supposed to be in syria for days that was many years ago we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area we quickly defeated of the isis caliphate  this makes nervous nancy every bit as guilty as liddle adam schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors and even treason i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly colluded with them must all be immediately impeached  nancy pelosi knew of all of the many shifty adam schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon congress and the american people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan whistleblower amp lawyer  forgot to report that we are helping the great farmers of the usa to the tune of billion dollars for the last two years paid for out of tariffs paid to the united states by china for targeting the farmer they devalued their currency therefore

2019-10-09,daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way  president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court he signed it anyway if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought if they do what is right and do not let  so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else s campaign in order to win

have been in middle east moved our soldiers out turkey must take over captured isis fighters that europe refused to have returned the stupid endless wars for us are ending  so make all member countries pay not just the united states  he should be impeached for fraud  the whistleblower s facts have been so incorrect about my no pressure conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly this is no whistleblower  the whistleblower s lawyer is a big democrat the
