    "## What we accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "We had to work with two different kinds of data: text from Trump's tweets and market data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained, parsed, cleaned, and made Trump's tweet data easily accessible through the TweetData class. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained high quality market datasets, and learned juggle with futures and options data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We scraped hundreds of options settlement files, and set different classes to be able to obtain information as necessary, such as in the FuturesData, RatesCure, FuturesCurve, and VolCurve classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had to find futures and options expirations for each of 13 different asset classes and all the caveats for each to solve our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volatility\n",
    "We learned how to obtain information such as implied volatility and gamma, out of options prices, and looked for ways to summarize this information in a way relevant to our problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text\n",
    "We worked built WordEmbeddings using a neural network Skipgram model and used the embeddings to generate topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used Vader for generating sentiments of tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features \n",
    "We designed dozens of features to try to predict market direction, both from futures and options data, as well as from Trump's tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "We looked at issues that are particular to finance, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high variance in models, time series analysis, and data leakage, We attempted to use information that was available at the time of making trading decisions. We looked at appropriate measures for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Importance\n",
    "Keeping model interpretability was highly important for us. Looking at the top 10 predictors and the amount they explained in the total model is extremely powerful for us. This leaves the door open for further analysis and ask new questions. To quote Marco's First Law of Backtesting- \"Backtesting is not a research tool. Feature importance is.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### Teamwork\n",
    "We had a team working on opposite sides of the globe one in New York and two in UAE. We come from different backgrounds, nationalities and work experiences. It was a very fun and interesting aspect of the project! Powered by Github and Canvas of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we missed\n",
    "The gamma features weren't as significant as other features, which was disappointing given the amount of work involved in obtaining them. Theres room to learn what could have been done to make them more relevant as in theory they seem like very powerful features to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "We predicted 1 day direction of markets. I think that this is sub-optimal, and a larger trading time frame would have probably been more suitable. The issue with predicting more than 1 day return is your returns start overlapping. Two contiguous 5 day returns will have 4 days of overlap, and so assumptions like independence start breaking. We read about some approaches to fix this, so as using bagging with each bag only using non-interlapping data, but we didn't have time to explore this facet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built in the capability of the model to not trade if it wasn't sure enough of market direction, but we didn't explore how it would compare to our results since it would have taken an extensive cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would've loved to craft 'hand-curated' topics by feeding in 'seed words' and extracting topics from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We realize how important is to approach statistical modeling with patience, caution and an inquisitive mindset. It's extremely easy to have a wrong input in the model and have completely erroneous results.\n",

    "A project from this class, two years ago, found that 5 minute returns was the most predictive out of short term returns. Instead of focusing on the most predictive return, we looked at the difference between 15 minute returns and 5 minute returns as well as an average of 1, 5, and 15 minute returns when we created some of our features.\n",
